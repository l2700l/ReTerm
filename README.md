## About

<table><tr><td>

Full featured terminal simulator.

There are many implementations of such terminals on the Internet, but, in my opinion, they are not functional enough. They represent the output of texts or elements on a predetermined command. 
This simulator also supports the launch of third-party applications, the configuration of which is set from the outside.

The goal of the project is to create a universal simulator with support for a virtual file system and running third-party applications

- Customizable commands,  user, name and prompt.
- Virtual file system.
- Support third-party applications.
- Command history using arrow up and down.
- Support for copy/paste.
- Customizing theme.

### Built With

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [react-device-detect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-device-detect)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Your project must be a React app, version 17 or higher

### Installation

To install the library, write
```npm install reterm``` (or another package manager)
in your project.

This will also install the react-detect-device library.

## Usage

You can use both the simulator itself and the terminal, which is a GUI wrapper over the simulator.

```typescript jsx
import {Terminal} from 'reterm';


function App(props) {
  return (
    <Terminal
      startMessage={'Hi!'}
      prompt={'>>>'}
    />
  );
}
```
```typescript jsx
import {Simulator} from 'reterm';


function App(props) {
  const fs = {
    'file': 'someText',
    Directory: {
      'file1': '=)',
      'file2': 'UwU'
    }
  }
  return (
    <Simulator
      user={'reterm'}
      name={'prod'}
      fs={fs}
      borderRadius={{topLeft: '1rem', topRight: '16px', bottomLeft: '10%', bottomRight: '1vw'}}
    />
  );
}
```
